# Hub HQ
Hub HQ is a data system I engineered in an effort to support Sunrise's hubs (groups of volunteers who carry out Sunrise's mission on the ground in their communitities) to abosorb and retain more members, reduce the amount of tedious spreadsheet tasks they had to do, and track the most important organizing information. This flow chart illustrates the data pipelines I build as a part of this project. You can find the Mobilize Sync and the EveryAction sync scripts in the Hub HQ folder of this repository:
